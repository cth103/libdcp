@mainpage libdcp

libdcp is a library to create Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) from
video, audio and subtitle data, and also to read and process existing
DCPs.

Most of the hard work is done by a (slightly patched) version of
asdcplib (http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/).

libdcp is distributed under the GNU GPL.
